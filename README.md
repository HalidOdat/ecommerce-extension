This is a browser extension that works with both Firefox and Google Chrome browsers, for eliminating the need for the mouse while browsing.

It offers two modes: "normal" mode for intuitive keyboard shortcuts and "link" mode activated by pressing 'a' (can be scaped using the `Escape` or `E` key).
In "normal" mode, easily navigate through pages, scroll smoothly, and access browsing history with simple keybindings (see <a href="#keybindings">keybindings</a> section).
In "link" mode, all links on the screen are marked, allowing quick access through letter combinations (taken from the home-row of a QWERTY keyboard).
