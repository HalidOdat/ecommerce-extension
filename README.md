An browser extension that works with both firefox and google chrome browsers, for eliminating the need for the mouse while browsing.

This is a browser extension for Firefox and Google Chrome that eliminates the need for a mouse while browsing.
This extension offers two modes: "normal" mode for intuitive keyboard shortcuts and "link" mode activated by pressing 'a'.
In "normal" mode, easily navigate through pages, scroll smoothly, and access browsing history with simple keybindings (see <a href="#keybindings">keybindings</a> section).
In "link" mode, all links on the screen are marked, allowing quick access through letter combinations (taken from the home-row of a QWERTY keyboard).
